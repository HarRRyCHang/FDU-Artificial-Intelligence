## Project Details


<h3 id="1">Project 1. Search in Pac-man</h3>

- Adapted from the Berkeley Pac-Man Assignments originally created by John DeNero and Dan Klein.
- This project is aimed at designing a intelligent Pacman agent that is able to find optimal paths through its maze world considering both reaching particular locations (e.g., finding all the corners) and eating all the dots in as few steps as possible. It can be separated as two subtasks: implementing graph search algorithms for DFS, BFS, UCS as well as A*, and use the search criteria outlined in the lectures to design effective heuristics.
- The detailed requirements are [here](https://github.com/Rshcaroline/FDU-Artificial-Intelligence/blob/master/Projects/PJ1%20-%20PacMan%20Search/pj-1-search.pdf). 
- Report of this project is [here](https://github.com/Rshcaroline/FDU-Artificial-Intelligence/blob/master/Projects/PJ1%20-%20PacMan%20Search/report.pdf).




<h3 id="2">Project 2. N Queens</h3>

- Adapted from *Course Scheduling of Stanford CS221*.
- It's a programming assignment for *CSP*.
- The detailed requirements are [here](https://github.com/Rshcaroline/FDU-Artificial-Intelligence/blob/master/Projects/PJ2%20-%20N%20Queens/requirement.pdf). 




<h3 id="9">Final project. Gomoku Competition</h3>

- Gomoku Rule: Standard Gomoku Rule(exact five)
- Balanced opening from a set
- The board has 20x20 squares
- 30 seconds per move, 180 seconds per match
- 10 fixed AI, 12 matches with each one
- 3 points for a win
- The detailed requirements are [here](https://github.com/Rshcaroline/FDU-Artificial-Intelligence/blob/master/Labs/OJ2/lab2.pdf). 




## Lab Details
